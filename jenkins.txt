After installing Maven in the server get some example maven project and create a repository in github and 
   drag maven project to the github repository. Here when you upload files src file doesnt upload to github. 
   So you must drag the whole project into github repository or you can push then using push command in the server.

4. Now open jenkins and select new item and select maven project and then go. If you dont find maven project there 
   you need to install maven plugins in jenkins. 

5. Go to manage jenkins and then manage plugins and then search maven plugins that connect to jenkins. 
   ( Maven integration plugin) 

6. Now go to new item and then select maven project and then configure and then clone git url in gitrepository 
   and github project. Then it will show error in build coloumn saying "Jenkins need to know where maven installed".

7. For that we need to go to global tool configuration and then select maven and let it know where maven is. 
   Maven url (/opt/maven).

8. Then build. It must provide target file where you can find jar file in it . Done .
